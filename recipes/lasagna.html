<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Ragu</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>1 medium cerrot</li>
    <li>1 stick of celery</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1kg minced beef</li>
    <li>800g crushed tomato</li>
    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 cup red wine</li>
    <li>3 beef stock cubes</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp each thyme and oregano</li>
    <li>2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
    <li>1-2 tsp sugar (<em>to taste</em>)</li>
    <li>salt and pepper(<em>to taste</em>)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cheese Sauce</h4>
<ul>
    <li>60g butter</li>
    <li>1/2 cup(75g) flour</li>
    <li>4 cups(1litre) milk</li>
    <li>2 cups(200g) grated cheese</li>
    <li>Pinch of nutmeg</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Ragu</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).
    </li>
    <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
    <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
    <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required</li>
</ol>
<h4>Cheese Sauce</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional – just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
    <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or milk.
